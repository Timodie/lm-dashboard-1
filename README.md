### Steps to run the server:

1. Go to **client** folder and run command **"npm install"**
2. After installing, run **"npm run build"** and then **"npm run watch"**. Do not close this window!
3. Open a new terminal tab/window, then go to **server** folder and run **"npm install"**
4. Finally, run **"node app.js"** in the same folder.

if everything good, you will get:
1. **Example app listening on port 3000**
2. The exact window you saw in the last presentation.
